      <p style='text-align: justify;'>The object detection system, developed using PixelLib, consistently achieved an accuracy rate of over 95% in various industrial environments. The model demonstrated reliable performance, even in challenging conditions such as low light, partial obstructions, and environmental noise. Solutions to address issues like lighting fluctuations and tag wear were successfully integrated, ensuring the system's robustness and dependability. By quickly and accurately identifying safety tags, the system plays a crucial role in enhancing safety compliance, reducing human error, and streamlining inspection processes. In conclusion, this project highlights how deep learning, powered by PixelLib, can deliver highly efficient, automated systems that significantly improve both operational efficiency and safety in industrial applications.</p>
